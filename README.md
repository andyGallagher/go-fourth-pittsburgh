# Go Fourth

This is the repo for the GoFourthPittsburgh.org site â€” a site that is designed as an audio tour and walking guide for Fourth Avenue Pittsburgh's Wall Street.

The first bank on Fourth Avenue opened in 1830, and the street was soon a preferred address for financial institutions. Then an earthshaking discovery in western Pennsylvania helped to transform the thoroughfare into the city's version of Wall Street.

In 1859, the world's first successful oil well was drilled near Titusville. Barrels of oil were rolled from the derrick to steamboats and shipped down the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh, where seven refineries were built within a year to turn the crude into lamp fuel. Suddenly Pittsburgh was awash in oil money.
